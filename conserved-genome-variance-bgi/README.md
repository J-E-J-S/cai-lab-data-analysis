## Conserved Genome Variance BGI  
### Guide    
This script will analyse whole genome sequence data from BGI for a collection of strains and return a dataframe with all genetic variance with >1 occurences filtered to parental strain variance and for quality reads.  
This script will also output a dataframe for each strain with collated variance and filtered for parental strain and quality reads.  
Create a new variable with a path to each strains `/SNV_Indel` dir
